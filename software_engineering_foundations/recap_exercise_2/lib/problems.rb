    # Sorting algorithms like bubble_sort, commonly accept a block. That block accepts
    # two parameters, which represents the two elements in the array being compared.
    # If the block returns 1, it means that the second element passed to the block
    # should go before the first (i.e. switch the elements). If the block returns -1,
    # it means the first element passed to the block should go before the second
    # (i.e. do not switch them). If the block returns 0 it implies that
    # it does not matter which element goes first (i.e. do nothing).

    # This should remind you of the spaceship operator! Convenient :)
